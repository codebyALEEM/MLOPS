# 🧠 Hands-on MLOps with MLflow

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end MLOps workflow** using **MLflow** — covering model training, experiment tracking, metric logging, artifact management, and model versioning.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) bridges the gap between **model development** and **production deployment**.
In this project, I implemented a **complete workflow** that automates and tracks each stage of the ML lifecycle using **MLflow**.

---

## 🧩 Key Features

✅ **Experiment Tracking with MLflow**

* Logs parameters, metrics, and artifacts for every experiment
* Tracks multiple models (Logistic Regression & Random Forest)
* Enables reproducibility and transparency across runs

✅ **Model Versioning**

* Automatically registers models in the MLflow Model Registry
* Maintains version control for iterative improvements

✅ **Artifact Logging**

* Generates and logs **confusion matrix heatmaps** for model evaluation
* Stores visual outputs for better interpretability

✅ **Reproducible ML Workflow**

* Consistent pipeline for data preparation, training, and evaluation
* Lightweight, modular Python code

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Pandas**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
* **MLflow**

## 📈 Results

Each experiment run is automatically tracked in MLflow, including:

* **Parameters:** Model hyperparameters
* **Metrics:** Accuracy scores
* **Artifacts:** Confusion matrix plots
* **Models:** Versioned and stored in the MLflow Model Registry

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

* Built a **fully tracked and reproducible ML pipeline**
* Simplified model comparison and experiment management
* Demonstrated how MLflow enables **visibility, control, and scalability** in ML workflows
